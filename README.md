# capstone2-enjoy-the-outdoors

<b>Description</b>: For this project, I developed a website dedicated to assisting users in discovering enjoyable outdoor activities. The website focuses on locating national parks for exploration and mountains for climbing. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct this interactive platform. One interesting thing I did for this project was using information from the already existing JavaScript arrays/objects to lead the users to the wikipedia page for more information if they wanted.
